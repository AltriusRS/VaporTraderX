## Getting Started

To use this bot, you will need to have a Discord account.

1. Log into your Discord account, and join the [official Vapor Trader Discord server](https://discord.gg/6k4paJCmkh).

2. Click on the user profile of the bot, and click on the "Add App" button.

3. In the modal that appears, you will be given two options:
   - **Try It Now**: This option allows you to use the bot anywhere on Discord, without having to be in the official Vapor Trader Discord server.
     > This option is preferred if you are unfamiliar with the bot, or if you do not wish to join any servers.

   - **Add to Server**: This option allows you to add the bot to your own server. Allowing you to use the bot only in servers which have the bot added.

4. What you will see now depends on which option you chose.
   > Please note that you may cancel this process at any time by clicking the "Back" button in the bottom left corner of the modal. If you cancel, you will not be able to use the bot.
   - **Try It Now**: If you selected this option, you will be prompted to "Authorise" the bot. Please be sure to thoroughly review the permissions that the bot is requesting, and make sure that you are comfortable with the access being granted.

   - **Add to Server**: If you selected this option, you will be prompted to "Add To Server". Please select the server you would like the bot to join, and click "Continue" in the bottom left corner of the modal. You will then be prompted to "Authorise" the bot. Please be sure to thoroughly review the permissions that the bot is requesting, and make sure that you are comfortable with the access being granted.

5. Once complete, you will be able to use the bot via the "slash commands" in your Discord client. Try it out by typing `/info` in your discord client, and selecting the command which is provided by Vapor Trader.

**Congratulations!** You have successfully set up the Vapor Trader Discord bot.
