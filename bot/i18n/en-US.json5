   Language file for VaporTrader
   This is a translation language file for VaporTrader which is used to provide language localization.
   The language file is written in JSON5 format.

   For more information on JSON5, see https://json5.org/

   To add a new language, copy this file, rename it to the language you want to add, and translate the contents.
   DO NOT change anything which is on the left side of the colon (:) character as this will break the language file.

   Anything on the right side of the colon (:) character is the value of the key.
   Anything wrapped in percentage signs is a parameter and should not be translated.

   For example, the following line:
   "constants.bot.footer": "Made with ❤️ by %Maintainer%",

   In German would be translated as:
   "constants.bot.footer": "Mit ❤️ erstellt von %Maintainer%",
